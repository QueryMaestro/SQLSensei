Here are the items we spoke about when making SQL Agent jobs HA-aware.

Job step
      _change database context to [master]
      _add replica or database property check
      _add set database syntax
      _add if...begin terminator

Job management
      _when creating new jobs, use the HA-aware code in the job steps and add to the secondary server
      _when disabling a job for an indefinite period, add a "delete after" note on the job on both primary and secondary replicas
      _when deleting jobs, make the commensurate delete operation on the secondary replica

Replica check (SQL 2014 and higher)
IF (SELECT [master].[sys].[fn_hadr_is_primary_replica]('<dbname>')) = 1
BEGIN
      USE [<dbname>];
END;

Database property check (SQL 2012 and lower)
IF (SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX('<dbname>', 'Updateability')) = 'READ_WRITE'
BEGIN
      USE [<dbname>];
END;
